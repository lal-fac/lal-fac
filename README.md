## Hi!

### About me

I'm a journalist turned programmer. I'm happy to say that the transition didn't cost me my favorite quality, curiosity. There's a lot that developers can learn from people who do research and ask questions for a living. The ability to look at something with fresh eyes and a desire to know more. Also, the often understated "watch, listen and learn what people want" process, essential in a bombshell interview or with a client who's not quite sure what the app they want is supposed to be. Let me ask you and learn what you need. From that understanding, we can work together and build something the whole web will enjoy.
