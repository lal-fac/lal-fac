## Hi!

### About me

I'm a journalist turned programmer. I'm happy to say that the transition didn't cost me my favorite quality, curiosity. There's a lot that developers can learn from people who do research and ask questions for a living. The ability to look at something with fresh eyes and a desire to know more. Also, the often understated "watch, listen and learn what people want" process, essential in a bombshell interview or with a client who's not quite sure what the app they want is supposed to be. Let me ask you and learn what you need. From that understanding, we can work together and build something the whole web will enjoy. 

### Toolbox

- JavaScript 
  * BackEnd:
    + NodeJs
    + Express
    + Sequelize
  * FrontEnd:
    + React
    + Redux

### Aspirations

- Python
- Big Data
- Machine Learning

### Projects

In my profile you'll find two fully coded repositories. 

The first one is a solo project: Classic Pokemon App. 
A single page application designed to display, search for, sort and filter first-generation Pokemon.
It features a Javascript-controlled form that links to a Postgres managed database for users to create their own Pokemon. 
Design-wise, I tried to keep it video-gamey without going full 8-bit, everything is styled with pure CSS.
Technologies used: 
 - JavaScript, SQL
 - PostgreSQL, Sequelize, NodeJS, Express
 - React, Redux, CSS modules.

The second one is a team project: ReMusic.
ReMusic is a social web community built around reviewing, scoring and sharing music.  
One of it's main axis is the dynamic, highly specific search engine. It allows for quering artists, albums, songs and users. It has several cross-search features and nested filters. Ideal for a library the size of ReMusic's. 
It has social-interaction features such as in-app chat, follow and like functionalities and a notification system. 
My main contribution to the project was the design and coding of the database models, it's cross-table relations and most of the back-end routes related to review creation and music data. I also managed the connection between the front-end and the server. 
Technologies used: 
 - JavaScript, SQL
 - PostgreSQL, Sequelize, NodeJS, Express
 - React, Redux, CSS modules
 - Firebase, Socket.io, Cloudinary
